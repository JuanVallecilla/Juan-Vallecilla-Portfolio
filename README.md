# Juan-Vallecilla-Portfolio
Created using THREE.JS, Javascript, HTML and css I create a 3D portfolio of a representation of my room.

Creating this website I learn Blender to create my own 3D assets and THREE.JS to display the models on the browser. I also learn GSAP to create animation using my model.
